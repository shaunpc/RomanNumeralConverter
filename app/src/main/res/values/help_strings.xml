            <p>Roman Numerals can be used to represent any Arabic Numeral between 1 and 3999, are
                generally are written in descending order from left to right, and are added sequentially.</p>
            <p>For example MMVI (2006) is interpreted as 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Certain combinations employ a subtractive principle which specifics that where a symbol
                of smaller value preceded a symbol of larger value, the smaller value is subtracted from
                the larger value, and the result is added to the total. </p>
            <p>For example, in MCMXLIV (1944) the symbols C,X and I each precede a symbol of higher value,
                and the results is interpreted as 1000 plus (1000 minus 100) plus (50 minus 10) plus (5 minus 1)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In addition to the additive and subtractive principles, there are also rules covering repetition of various symbols. </p>
            <p>For example, the Symbols I, X, C and M can be repeated up to three times in succession for addition, but no more. </p>
            <p>D, L and V can never be repeated.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>For subtraction, symbols cannot be repeated.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And to further complicate the representation:#x13&#x10;
                I can be subtracted from V and X only;#x13&#x10;
                X can be subtracted from L and C only;#x13&#x10;
                C can be subtracted from D and M only;#x13&#x10;
                V, L and D can never be subtracted</p>
